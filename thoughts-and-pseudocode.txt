Pseudocode
QuerySelector for the bet, the choice (red/black), and the button to bet
We use a random number generator to generate a number between 1 and 36. Let's call this number "final"
If final is included in array "Red" and the choice was Red, casino loses the bet, else casino wins the bet.
If final is inlucded in array "Black" and the choice was Black, casino loses the bet, else casino wins the bet.
In either case, we send over the result to the server.
